# RandomWalk
A visualization of a random walk using the Matplotlib library. 

This project is from Chapter 15 of the Python Crash Course book by Eric Matthes. In this project, we began learning data visualization within Python utilizing the Matplotlib library.

This is the final version of this project from the book, including refactoring I completed independently as part of an additional exercise.

Files consist of the following:
1. *random_walk.py* contains the RandomWalk class which will generate a random walk of 50_000 steps.
2. *rw_visual.py* is the main file for this project, which will take an instance of RandomWalk and plot it on a graph for visualization.
